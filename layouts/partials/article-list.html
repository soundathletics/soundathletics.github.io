        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Sound Athletics was established in the fall of 2002 by Gordie & Sherry Bowman to
            fulfill the needs of their son, Tim. Tim participated in the World Games in 1999. 
            Gordie was so inspired by the atmosphere at the Games that he wanted to provide a 
            program and opportunity to local families. Gordieâ€™s desire was to provide a safe and 
            friendly environment for athletes to come together and compete. Sound Athletics is an
            official local program of Special Olympics Washington, serving over 60 families in 
            the Tacoma/Puyallup area.
        </p>
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The mission of Sound Athletics is to provide a fun and safe environment for athletes
            of all abilities, ages 8 and over, to come together and participate in athletic endeavors.
