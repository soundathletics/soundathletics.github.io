# About Sound Athletics


We are a non-profit Special Olympics team serving the Tacoma/Puyallup area.
We provide both traditional and unified sports opportunities for Bowling (Fall), 
Basketball(Winter), and Track(Spring). Our coaching staff is trained to provide a safe 
teaching and training environment for our athletes. We welcome athletes of all 
abilities ages 8 and over.

## Who We Are
Sound Athletics was established in the fall of 2002 by Gordie & Sherry Bowman to
fulfill the needs of their son, Tim. Tim participated in the World Games in 1999. 
Gordie was so inspired by the atmosphere at the Games that he wanted to provide a 
program and opportunity to local families. Gordieâ€™s desire was to provide a safe and 
friendly environment for athletes to come together and compete. Sound Athletics is an
official local program of Special Olympics Washington, serving over 60 families in 
the Tacoma/Puyallup area.


## Our Mission
The mission of Sound Athletics is to provide a fun and safe environment for athletes
of all abilities, ages 8 and over, to come together and participate in athletic endeavors.
