## Our Mission
The mission of Sound Athletics is to provide a fun and safe environment for athletes of all abilities, ages 8 and over, to participate in athletic endeavors with no pay-to-play.

We serve the mission of Special Olympics Washington. To provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community.

Sound Athletics is a non-profit and an official local program of Special Olympics Washington, serving over a hundred families in 
the Tacoma/Puyallup area.

## Our History
Sound Athletics was established in the fall of 2002 by Gordie & Sherry to fulfill the needs of their son, Tim, who participated in the World Games in 1999. Gordie was so inspired by the atmosphere at the Games that he wanted to provide a program and opportunity to local families.
